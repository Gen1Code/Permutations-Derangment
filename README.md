# Permutations & Derangements Custom Theory

A Custom Theory for the mobile game [Exponential Idle](https://conicgames.github.io/exponentialidle/), the API and samples that helped create this come from [here](https://github.com/conicgames/theory-sdk)
To see the theory in game enter this link after pressing the '+' icon in the Custom Theory tab: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gen1Code/Permutations-Derangment/main/PD.js

The CT is based on the possible [arrangements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation) and [derangements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derangement) of objects. 
Permutations are the number of ways objects can be arranged as a different sequence, in this case a 'very' long string of text. 
Derangements are the number of ways all objects can be rearranged so that each object is not in its current position
